### Overview

Terraria is a 2D Sandbox game Developed by Re-logic. Terraria was released around the  same time as Minecraft and many other extremely popular indie games, but differs in that its 2D. Unlike many 2D games the character has a free range of movement in a randomly generated world as a pose to being confined to levels - with it being a sandbox the player can also alter the layout of the game by mining for resources and placing blocks. The overall aim is to gather increasingly better resources and equipment so that you and friends can beat all of the games bosses.

### Gameplay

Once again, Terraria's gameplay is very much different to other 2D platformers in that you have free range to do what you wish to do within the confines of the Game. However, as I said before, there is a natural progression to the game in which the player will mine for resources and use these to create better armors, weapons and tools. Then with the new equipment you will defeat a boss to unlock new gear and the next boss, and so, you repeat this process.&#x20;

### Controls&#x20;

Terraria is available on all platforms - that I know of - with the most popular being Console and PC. The controls are pretty standard for both PC and Console, with - for console - Right Joystick being used for movement; Left Joystick for camera; A,B,X,Y or X,O,△,□ being used to interact with stuff and open Inventory; Right Trigger for Attacking; it has numerous other key binds that aren't necessarily important. The controls follow the same layout as most other games which allow most people to easily get used to them, making the game easily accessible to any moderate gamers.

| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Variety of Weapons / Items              | I would like to try and include a variety of weapons / items that the player can use to defeat bosses and enemies. This probably wouldnt be super difficult to add to the game however it may be quite time consuming.                                                                                                                       |
| Freeroam / Non level based game design  | Whilst It may be difficult to find a way to implement this into my game - I would like to have some form of non restricted Hub from which you can go to levels and perhaps a looser level design. A looser level design than that of Mario or other sidescrollers would allow for a more difficult, interactive experience within the game.  |

| Random Generation  | I will not include any form of randomly generated levels as although I would like the player to have a somewhat unique experience whilst playing - It would probably take too much time and would largely be unnecessary to make randomly generated levels.   |
