### Overview

Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Platformer game Developed by Re-logic. Terraria was released around the  same time as Minecraft and many other extremely popular indie games, but differs in that its 2D. Unlike many 2D games the character has a free range of movement in a randomly generated world as a pose to being confined to levels - with it being a sandbox the player can also alter the layout of the game by mining for resources and placing blocks. The overall aim is to gather increasingly better resources and equipment so that you and friends can beat all of the games bosses.

### Gameplay

Once again, Terraria's gameplay is very much different to other 2D platformers in that you have free range to do what you wish to do within the confines of the Game. However, as I said before, there is a natural progression to the game in which the player will mine for resources and use these to create better armors, weapons and tools. Then with the new equipment you will defeat a boss to unlock new gear and the next boss, and so, you repeat this process.&#x20;
