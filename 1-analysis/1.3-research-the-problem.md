## Terraria&#x20;

### Overview

Terraria is a 2D Sandbox game Developed by Re-logic. Terraria was released around the  same time as Minecraft and many other extremely popular indie games, but differs in that its 2D. Unlike many 2D games the character has a free range of movement in a randomly generated world as a pose to being confined to levels - with it being a sandbox the player can also alter the layout of the game by mining for resources and placing blocks. The overall aim is to gather increasingly better resources and equipment so that you and friends can beat all of the games bosses.

### Gameplay

Once again, Terraria's gameplay is very much different to other 2D platformers in that you have free range to do what you wish to do within the confines of the Game. However, as I said before, there is a natural progression to the game in which the player will mine for resources and use these to create better armors, weapons and tools. Then with the new equipment you will defeat a boss to unlock new gear and the next boss, and so, you repeat this process.&#x20;

### Controls&#x20;

![Keyboard and Mouse](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

Terraria is available on all platforms - that I know of - with the most popular being Console and PC. The controls are pretty standard for both PC and Console, with - for console - Right Joystick being used for movement; Left Joystick for camera; A,B,X,Y or X,O,△,□ being used to interact with stuff and open Inventory; Right Trigger for Attacking; it has numerous other key binds that aren't necessarily important. The controls follow the same layout as most other games which allow most people to easily get used to them, making the game easily accessible to any moderate gamers.

| Variety of Weapons / Items              | I would like to try and include a variety of weapons / items that the player can use to defeat bosses and enemies. This probably wouldnt be super difficult to add to the game however it may be quite time consuming.                                                                                                                       |
| Freeroam / Non level based game design  | Whilst It may be difficult to find a way to implement this into my game - I would like to have some form of non restricted Hub from which you can go to levels and perhaps a looser level design. A looser level design than that of Mario or other sidescrollers would allow for a more difficult, interactive experience within the game.  |

| Random Generation  | I will not include any form of randomly generated levels as although I would like the player to have a somewhat unique experience whilst playing - It would probably take too much time and would largely be unnecessary to make randomly generated levels.   |

## Super Mario Bros&#x20;

### Overview&#x20;

The Mario franchise is arguably one of the most influential and successful games franchises of all time. Super Mario Bros is a 2D platformer / sidescroller game that revolves around an Italian plumber, Mario, trying to rescue a princess from a big angry turtle, Bowser.  Along the way you can encounter different enemies and you can obtain different powerups to alter the gameplay. Mario mixes a simple base concept with a variety of more complex enemies and level design to create a well rounded game.

### Controls&#x20;

Super Mario Bros was released originally on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. The NES is a very outdated system by todays standards and had quite a primitive set of controls, with them only having a D-pad and A/B buttons. The controls are very simple with the D-pad being used to move and the A/B buttons being used to preform certain actions. These controls are very simple which makes the game easily accessible to people who may not play game regularly or may not be used to the controls. &#x20;

### Gameplay&#x20;

There is not much to really talk about concerning gameplay as its very simple. Basically you just need to get Mario to the castle at the end of the level by avoiding obstacles such as enemies and traps. Mario can get certain power ups to make it easier to complete the level, Mario can get bigger by eating a mushroom which essentially gives him another life, he can collect a star and become invincible, and other ones.&#x20;

| Feature     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| Simplicity  | This may be broad but in order to have my game running smoothly and being playable - I need to understand the limitations and time frame I've got. By keeping my game relatively simple I will be able to actually make a working game that I can add complexity to further down the line. |   |
| Power Ups   | I think adding power ups similar to the ones used in Mario would result in a more enjoyable experience playing the game.                                                                                                                                                                   |   |
| Art  Style  | A simple pixel style is classic and simple. Using a pixel based art style allows me to dedicate more time to making the actual game work better while still having it look good.                                                                                                           |   |

## Battle Block Theatre&#x20;

![Battle Block Theatre ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

### Overview&#x20;

Battle Block Theatre is a 2D platformer developed by The Behemoth for Xbox 360, Windows and Mac. The main plot is that, Hatty Hattington and all his friends go on a fun adventure on a boat but the boat gets stranded on an island of cats that abduct Hatty and make him wear this hat that controls his mind and the main character has to rescue Hatty, by completing a bunch of levels, but when they do Hatty seems weird.&#x20;

### Gameplay

The Gameplay is pretty much the same as Mario with a few differences. Similarly it works on a level by level basis and within the level you need to collect at least 3 crystals to end the levels. The Game also has a multitude of enemies within the level to provide some combat, however they don't just work on a simple collide and die basis but you can fight them either by melee or projectiles. These projectile attacks come in a variety of different forms from Frisbee to Acid Bubble. Also differing from Mario is the actual level design in which you have somewhat the ability to make your own way round and aren't forced into just going from left to right.

### Story Inclusion&#x20;

There is a story to the game, as described in the overview, but it is quite simple and not mandatory for playing the game. The story is simply to rescue Hatty after he put on a hat and became a truly terrible person - this is done by completing levels in an abandoned theatre. However, as i said before, the simple nature of the story allows players to chose whether or not they pay attention to it.

| More Open Level Design      | I think that a more open level design allows for a more personal experience in playing the game. Having each level be more like a maze with multiple exits would allow for a somewhat more immersive playthrough and would keep the game interesting upon 2nd and 3rd playthroughs. |   |
| Different weapons           | I like the idea of being able to have a multitude of attacks / weapons for the player to use. This would be time consuming to make so i may not be able to include it.                                                                                                              |   |
| Range of Traps and Enemies  | I think the range of obstacles that you can face within B.B.T would be a good addition to my game as it makes the game more interesting and perhaps difficult - rather than just having mindless Goombas for example.                                                               |   |
