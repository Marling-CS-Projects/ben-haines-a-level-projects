### Overview

Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Platformer game Developed by Re-logic. Terraria was released around the  same time as Minecraft and many other extremely popular indie games, but differs in that its 2D. Unlike many 2D games the character has a free range of movement in a randomly generated world as a pose to being confined to levels - with it being a sandbox the player can also alter the layout of the game by mining for resources and placing blocks. The overall aim is to gather increasingly better resources and equipment so that you and friends can beat all of the games bosses.
