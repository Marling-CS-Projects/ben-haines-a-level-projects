# 1.1 Problem Identification

During the Covid-19 pandemic because of worldwide lockdowns we have seen an overall decline in positive mental heath - (specifically in youth) - video games can provide us with the means to socialize and to better enjoy our lives whilst indoors and can create a positive impact on worldwide mental health. A 2014 journal states how gaming may be the one of the most effective and efficient ways for children and youth to generate positive emotions ([Granic, Lobel and Rutger C. M. E. Engels, 2014b](../reference-list.md)) and so, gaming during COVID-19 and other prolonged periods indoors, may be an invaluable stimuli for youth who otherwise may be experiencing poor mental health.

Similarly gaming has shown to improve cognitive function for people of all ages, a late 1990s study into how well a person can search for a particular shown with a lot of the participants getting near perfect results, and when surveyed it was found that the majority of the near perfect scores had spent an excess of 10 hours on the then new game 'Team Fortress Classic.' ([Bavelier and Green, 2016](../reference-list.md)) and although 2D platformers are about as simple as video games can get, integrating puzzles and more complex mechanics into the relatively simple framework may provide , again, the  stimuli needed to challenge are brains.&#x20;

2D platformers are probably one of the most common and oldest form of video games, with games like Donkey Kong opening the gates for nearly a decade of 2D platformers dominating the market from 1981 until the late 80s early 90s, with the Donkey Kong franchise selling over 65 million copies as of March 2021 ([Nintendo Co., Ltd., n.d.](../reference-list.md)) and since this point the 2D platformer has evolved into a much more complex and broad genre than it once was, with games like 'Dead Cells' being a far cry from Donkey Kong 1981 and games like 'Terraria' expanding upon this genre and becoming '2D sandboxes'. This variation of complexity in 2D platformers is what makes it the best candidate for my Project.
