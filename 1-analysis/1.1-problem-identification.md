During the Covid-19 pandemic because of worldwide lockdowns we have seen an overall decline in positive mental heath - (specifically in youth) - video games can provide us with the means to socialize and to better enjoy our lives whilst indoors and can create a positive impact on worldwide mental health. A 2014 journal states how gaming may be the one of the most effective and efficient ways for children and youth to generate positive emotions ([Granic, Lobel and Rutger C. M. E. Engels, 2014b](../reference-list.md)) and so, gaming during COVID-19 and other prolonged periods indoors, may be an invaluable stimuli for youth who otherwise may be experiencing poor mental health.

Similarly gaming has shown to improve cognitive function for people of all ages, a late 1990s study into how well a person can search for a particular shown with a lot of the participants getting near perfect results, and when surveyed it was found that the majority of the near perfect scores had spent an excess of 10 hours on the then new game 'Team Fortress Classic' ([Bavelier and Green, 2016](../reference-list.md))
