## User Requirements

Because I am using the website 'Repl.it' to develop my game, the user will be restricted to playing my game on a PC or Laptop from their web browser. Although repl.it is accessible on mobile devices I will not be taking the time to develop touch controls for my game. The Three most popular Web Browsers are; Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OS1" %}
| Platform      | Requirements                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Chrome | <ul><li>Requirement 1</li><li>Requirement 1</li></ul> |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
