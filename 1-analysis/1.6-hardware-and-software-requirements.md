# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

I have decides to develop my game on Repl.it, Repl.it is an online integrated development environment - this means the requirements for me as a developer are the same as the requirements needed to run the web browser I will be using.

| Software | Hardware Required                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chrome   | <ul><li>Windows 7 or higher</li><li>128 MB RAM</li><li>100MB HD space</li></ul> |

## User Requirements

Because I am using the website 'Repl.it' to develop my game, the user will be restricted to playing my game on a PC or Laptop from their web browser. Although Repl.it is accessible on mobile devices I will not be taking the time to develop touch controls for my game. The Three most popular Web Browsers are; Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. [(May 2021 and P.m, 2021)](../reference-list.md)
