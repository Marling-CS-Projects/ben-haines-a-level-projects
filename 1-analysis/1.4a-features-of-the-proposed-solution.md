# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### Movement

The movement of the player will remain quite simple, with the character being able to jump, walk/run and dash. Similar to most other games - the player will be able to walk around at a constant speed using the arrow keys. The player will be able to jump using the space bar, this will probably be limited to a constant height. I may try to make it so that the longer you hold down the space bar the longer the jump charges and the larger the jump height - however, this may not be necessary in the long run. Dashing will be a short boost of speed that can damage enemies and move the player quicker, using down and either left or right arrow keys will preform a Dash.&#x20;

### Physics

#### Collisions&#x20;

The player will collide with anything that isn't the background. Upon colliding with an enemy or obstacle the player will die. All platforms will be solid causing the player to collide with them and be able to use them to navigate the level. The player will collide with 'Coins' to determine the score at the end of the level.

#### Gravity&#x20;

Gravity is pretty self explanatory, the player will always fall down when in the air. However certain objects such as platforms will not.&#x20;

### Controls

I will be using the standard PC controls layout of WASD to move, SPACEBAR to jump and, LEFT CLICK to attack. There will probably be other keys for different operations but I wont go into that now. Keyboard and Mouse will be well suited for assigning all the keys I may or may not need. Also a good chunk of Gamers are PC based or regularly use keyboard and mouse so it will be easy to learn the controls for most players, meaning the game is easily accessible to new players and a wide audience.



## Level Design

### View Centered on the Player&#x20;

The Camera player i will remain centered on the player and follow the player at all times allowing the player to have more freedom traversing the level as a pose to average sidescroller platformers.&#x20;

### Enemies

Enemies are an effective way of making the level more challenging for the player. By adding a range of enemies spread out around the level it will stop the player simply running through each level with ease - this would be extremely boring to play. Enemies are also an effective way of keeping the player engaged as (as i said before) they provide a challenge to the player.

### Obstacles&#x20;

In addition to Enemies there will also be obstacles and traps to add an extra challenge to the level. Most traps will be able to harm the player by way of bottomless pits, spikes and explosives; all of these would kill the player instantly. There would also be obstacles that the player has to traverse around, to progress through the level - these would just be simple walls / barriers.

### Layout&#x20;

&#x20;Each level will consist of of platforms in a 2D area for the player to traverse until they reach and ending checkpoint. The player will jump from platform to platform in order to move around. The player will be limited by physics (i.e. gravity) and collisions with platforms and walls.&#x20;

## Graphics and UI&#x20;

### Graphics&#x20;

![More complex pixel art style displayed in Terraria ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

I will be using a pixelated style for my game as its a simple and classic look for a game that is not too difficult to design. A pixel art style allows me to create a simple base game design and characters, but will also allow for more detail later down the line so that I can better flesh out the world.&#x20;

### User Interface&#x20;

For the game to work smoothly, it needs a simple and understandable user interface so that the player can navigate levels, load saves, change character and whatnot. Within the level the game will have again a simple UI with the player being able to see a coin counter, their healthbar and what attack they're using.&#x20;

### Saving System&#x20;

I would like to implement a saving system to my game so that the player doesn't lose their progress  , I personally, as do many others, don't like to lose all my progress in a game so a saving system saves people the frustration of having to redo all the levels. However because of how short the game will be it probably wont be detrimental if there wasn't a saving system .



## Limitations

### Graphics and Animations&#x20;

It will impractical for me to dedicate too much time to graphics and animating the players movement. I would rather focus on the overall functionality of the game rather than making the game look amazing.

### Game Length&#x20;

I don't have enough time to create an 80 hour game that is fully functional, so I will probably aim for 30 - 45 mins of gameplay consisting of 5 - 10 levels.

### Cross Platform&#x20;

My game will be designed for PC only and specifically keyboard and mouse. I will not have time to develop the game for mobile and console. Again because I would rather focus on the games functionality rather than having it be cross platform.&#x20;

### Performance&#x20;

The games performance may be limited as I'm designing the game to be web based and so the performance will be determined by the browser your playing it in.
