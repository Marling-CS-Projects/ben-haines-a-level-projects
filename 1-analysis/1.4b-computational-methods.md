## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is a method of removing any unnecessary details from ( in this case ) the design frame, for example for my game it is unnecessary for me to animate some of the sprites, so i would remove that from the design frame in order to allocate myself more time to focus on necessary features. Thinking Abstractly is import in order to create a functional, complete game within a certain amount of time. The features I will be focusing on are:

* Level Layout - The layout doesn't need to be overtly complex it only needs to have platforms, traps / obstacles and enemies.
*

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking Ahead is a vital part of the Design and Development cycle of my game production, thinking ahead is (in context) considering what you want your final product to be and deciding what procedures and inputs you need to get you to that point. This is necessary to streamline the development process by knowing what you will need to do going into it.

Some features are more important to complete than others ,for example, having the player be able to move is more important than adding puzzles to the level. Thinking ahead would allow me to consider things like this and complete them before the less necessary features of the game.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking a large problem into a few or many smaller and more manageable sub-problems. These sub-problems are more understandable and easier to 'tackle' (programme).&#x20;

This is important as the concept of creating a whole game could be quite overwhelming, but if you break it down into smaller parts like: making the player move; adding a start screen; adding enemies; etc. With each of these sub-problems being more manageable, it gives you - as the developer - a better layout for creating this game, making the task less daunting.

In each development cycle I will need to focus on one of these sub-problems, which in turn will total up to my desired outcome, this allows me to focus on development without being overwhelmed by a large workload.
