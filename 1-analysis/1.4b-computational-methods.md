## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is a method of removing any unnecessary details from ( in this case ) the design frame, for example for my game it is unnecessary for me to animate some of the sprites, so i would remove that from the design frame in order to allocate myself more time to focus on necessary features. Thinking Abstractly is import in order to create a functional, complete game within a certain amount of time. The features I will be focusing on are:&#x20;

* Level Layout - The layout doesn't need to be overtly complex it only needs to have platforms, traps / obstacles and enemies.&#x20;
* &#x20;
