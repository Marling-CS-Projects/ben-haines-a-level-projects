## Gamers

Naturally when making a game - the main demographic will be Gamers. Luckily, Gamers is huge demographic, with the number of people who game regularly far exceeding 2.69 billion people, with the actual figure expected to reach 3.07 billion by the end of 2023 ([Gilbert, 2020](../reference-list.md)). With this many people regularly playing games, large portions of them will tend to play certain types of games over others - Action Games (platformers included) are the most popular type of game with 35% of gamers playing them regularly ([Kunst, 2022](../reference-list.md)).&#x20;

For me to make a successful and popular game, i need to recognize what people want from a game. While I may not be able to tick every single box of what all 2.69 billion gamers want - I can however focus in on a particular demographic.&#x20;
