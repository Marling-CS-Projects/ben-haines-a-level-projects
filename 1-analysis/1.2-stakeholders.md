## PEGI

![PEGI age ratings](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

PEGI is a Standardized Age rating system for games that is recognized across Europe. It has Content Descriptors to inform the buyer of content within the game these include violence, bad language, fear, sex, drugs, discrimination and in-game purchases - depending on which of these Content descriptors a game has it will be given a rating from 3 to 18.  For Example, Minecraft has a PEGI 7+ rating as it has Fantasy Violence and Fear so is not suitable for children under 7.

I would give my game a 12 for its fantasy violence, drug references. I don't think the overall theme behind the game would be suitable for those under 12 and those under 12 probably wouldn't enjoy it anyway. However, despite this rating i still have the majority of the gaming demographic available  with the average gamer being 34 years old and with 38% of gamers being aged between 18 and 34 ([Yanev, 2019](../reference-list.md)) - I couldn't find any data for people under 18, probably because of laws about research with kids.

## Gamers

Naturally when making a game - the main demographic will be Gamers. Luckily, Gamers is huge demographic, with the number of people who game regularly far exceeding 2.69 billion people, with the actual figure expected to reach 3.07 billion by the end of 2023 ([Gilbert, 2020](../reference-list.md)). With this many people regularly playing games, large portions of them will tend to play certain types of games over others - Action Games (platformers included) are the most popular type of game with 35% of gamers playing them regularly ([Kunst, 2022](../reference-list.md)).&#x20;

For me to make a successful and popular game, I need to recognize what people want from a game. While I may not be able to tick every single box of what all 2.69 billion gamers want - I can however focus in on a particular demographic. So I will aim to make my game appeal to the 2D platformer community whilst also keeping the PEGI rating higher in order to appeal to a slightly older - more likely to buy games - age range of 15+.
