# 1.5 Success Criteria

### Game Layout and Design&#x20;

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reference |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
|          |                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |           |
| 1        |  There should be at least 3 different levels. | 3 separate levels is a good goal to set myself for development and should be enough levels for people to get an idea of what the game is about.                                                                            |           |
| 2        | The levels get progressively harder.          | The game should be challenging but its probably best not to throw players straight in the deep end by instead having it get more challenging level by level.                                                               |           |
| 3        | The levels have a clear progression.          | As enjoyable as being dropped into a game and having to figure out what to do can be. I think that to hold better player retention, especially with a game as simple as this, the levels need to have a clear progression. |           |
| 4        | The levels need obstacles.                    | The levels need different features to stop the level just being an empty pathway.                                                                                                                                          |           |
| 5        | The levels need enemies.                      | The main problem with traps is that the simple ones are stationary, and are fairly easy to dodge / avoid. So adding moving enemies adds a new layer of difficulty.                                                         |           |

```
                                                                 |
```

### Mechanics&#x20;

| Ref. No. | Criterion                   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                               | Reference  |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 6        | Make the the player move    | The game is unplayable if the player cant move.                                                                                                                                             |            |
| 7        | 'Solid' platforms and walls | Having solid platforms and walls is necessary as without it the player would just fall infinitely. This is already built in to kaboom.js.                                                   |            |
| 8        | Player Following Camera     | My levels will not necessarily follow a classic, horizontal left to right level design. So a standard side scroller view would not work, instead i will have the camera follow the player.  |            |

### User Interface

| Ref. No. | Criterion                     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Reference |

| 9        | Easy to use title screen.     | Its the first thing people see of your game, therefore it must be clear what they have to do to start the game. It should also reflect the theme of the game.                                                                                                   |           |
| 10       | Easy to navigate levels.      | The levels need to be easy to navigate, whether this means they simply start one after the other or having a level selection menu.                                                                                                                              |           |
| 11       | There should be a stopwatch.  | When the player starts the level a timer should start and finish upon completing the level, then the time should be displayed at the end.                                                                                                                       |           |
| 12       | There should be a pause menu. | Upon pausing the level, the stopwatch should stop and there should be a simple menu giving the player the option to resume or leave.                                                                                                                            |           |
| 13       | Level finish/stats screen.    | Upon finishing the level  there should be a screen before going to the next level, which would display the time taken to complete the level and how much money you collected. It would also give the player the option to continue the level or return to menu. |           |
|          |                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |           |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 14       | The game has to run without crashing. | If the game crashes regularly, the player retention would be minimal so to keep people playing the game it must run without crashing.                                                                                | Stakeholders |
| 15       | The game should run at 30 fps         | A low frame rate will cause the game to look laggy and jolty, having a higher frame rate will allow the game to look 'smoother'. 30 fps is a reasonable goal to aim for and will allow for the 'smooth' look i want. |              |
| 16       | The game should have a theme.         | Having a recognisable theme for the game                                                                                                                                                                             |              |
|          |                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |              |
