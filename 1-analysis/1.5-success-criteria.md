# 1.5 Success Criteria

### Game Layout and Design&#x20;

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                             | Justification                                                                                                                                                                  | Reference |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1        | The levels should be made up of a series of platforms, traps and enemies.             | Each level needs to consist of more than just an endless void so that it can actually be enjoyable - these three features would provide a point and a challenge to the level.  |           |
| 2        |  There should be at least 3 different levels.                                         | 3 separate levels is a good goal to set myself for development and should be enough levels for people to get an idea of what the game is about.                                |           |
| 3        | The levels get progressively harder.                                                  | The game should be challenging but its probably best not to throw players straight in the deep end by instead having it get more challenging level by level.                   |           |
| 4        | The levels have a clear progression, and contain enemies and traps to add difficulty. | The game needs different features for it to be interesting, enemies and traps will be fine for making the level interesting and challenging.                                   |           |
| 5        |                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                |           |

|          | Make the the player move | For a 2D platformer ,like the one I'm making, the player needs to move. |            |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 21       | The game has to run without crashing. | If the game crashes regularly, the player retention would be minimal so to keep people playing the game it must run without crashing.                                                                                | Stakeholders |
| 22       | The game should run at 30 fps         | A low frame rate will cause the game to look laggy and jolty, having a higher frame rate will allow the game to look 'smoother'. 30 fps is a reasonable goal to aim for and will allow for the 'smooth' look i want. |              |
| 23       | The game should have a theme.         | To make people more likely to play the game having a recognisable theme would be                                                                                                                                     |              |
