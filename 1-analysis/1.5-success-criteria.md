| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                  | Reference |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1        | The levels should be made up of a series of platforms, traps and enemies. | Each level needs to consist of more than just an endless void so that it can actually be enjoyable - these three features would provide a point and a challenge to the level.  |           |
| 2        |  There should be at least 3 different levels.                             | 3 separate levels is a good goal to set myself for development and should be enough levels for people to get an idea of what the game is about.                                |           |
| 3        | The levels get progressively harder.                                      | The game should be challenging but its probably best not to throw players straight in the deep end by instead having it get more challenging level by level.                   |           |
|          |                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                |           |

```
                                                                 |
```

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 21       | The game has to run without crashing. | If the game crashes regularly, the player retention would be minimal so to keep people playing the game it must run without crashing. | Stakeholders |
