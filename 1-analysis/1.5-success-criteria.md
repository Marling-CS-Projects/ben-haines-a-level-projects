| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
|          |                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |           |
| 1        |  There should be at least 3 different levels. | 3 separate levels is a good goal to set myself for development and should be enough levels for people to get an idea of what the game is about.                                                                            |           |
| 2        | The levels get progressively harder.          | The game should be challenging but its probably best not to throw players straight in the deep end by instead having it get more challenging level by level.                                                               |           |
| 3        | The levels have a clear progression.          | As enjoyable as being dropped into a game and having to figure out what to do can be. I think that to hold better player retention, especially with a game as simple as this, the levels need to have a clear progression. |           |
| 4        | The levels need obstacles.                    | The levels need different features to stop the level just being an empty pathway.                                                                                                                                          |           |
| 5        | The levels need enemies.                      | The main problem with traps is that the simple ones are stationary, and are fairly easy to dodge / avoid. So adding moving enemies adds a new layer of difficulty.                                                         |           |
|          |                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |           |

```
                                                                 |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 21       | The game has to run without crashing. | If the game crashes regularly, the player retention would be minimal so to keep people playing the game it must run without crashing.                                                                                | Stakeholders |
| 22       | The game should run at 30 fps         | A low frame rate will cause the game to look laggy and jolty, having a higher frame rate will allow the game to look 'smoother'. 30 fps is a reasonable goal to aim for and will allow for the 'smooth' look i want. |              |
| 23       | The game should have a theme.         | To make people more likely to play the game having a recognisable theme would be                                                                                                                                     |              |
