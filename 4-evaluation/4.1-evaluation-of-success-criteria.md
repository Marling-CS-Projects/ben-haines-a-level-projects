# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Game Layout and Design

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1         | There should be at least 3 levels.   | Cycle 9              |
| 2         | The levels get progressively harder. | Usability Testing    |
| 3         | The levels have a clear progression. | Cycle 3              |
| 4         | The levels need obstacles            | Cycle 7              |
| 5         | The levels need enemies              | Cycle 6              |

### Criterion 1

\--(No great way of showing each level so you just have to take my word for it)--

I have created 3 similar but different levels, the first one can be accessed from the start menu and the rest on completion of the level before.

### Criterion 2&#x20;

\--(Again, no great way to show this visually)--

I designed the levels to get marginally harder with each new one, this is shown in usability testing.

### Criterion 3&#x20;

\--(This seems redundant at this point)--

Despite the levels being somewhat challenging, they still have a relatively simple layout, with a simple progression. This is also shown in usability testing.

### Criterion 4

I have added an obstacle to my game and if the player collides with it, he dies/ the level ends.

### Criterion 5&#x20;

Enemies work in much the same way as obstacles except they move left and right.

## Mechanics

| Criterion | Description                     | When was it achieved? |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 6         | Make the the player move        | Cycle 1               |
| 7         | Add solid platforms and walls   | Cycle 2               |
| 8         | Have a player following camera. | Cycle 4               |

### Criterion 6

I have assigned movement to the A, D, and SPACE keys so that the player can move left and right as well as jump.

### Criterion 7

I drew simple sprites for the floors and walls and made them 'solid' - basically just meaning the player wont fall through them. Kaboom.js already has a physics and gravity system integrated into it, so thats why i only had to add solid platforms to allow the player to traverse the level.

### Criterion 8

The camera follows the player as they traverse the level, this allows the player to explore the level at their own pace and not be restricted by a side scrolling view.

## User Interface

| Criterion | Description                                | When was it achieved? |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 9         | There must be an easy to use title screen. |                       |
| 10        |                                            |                       |
| 11        |                                            |                       |
