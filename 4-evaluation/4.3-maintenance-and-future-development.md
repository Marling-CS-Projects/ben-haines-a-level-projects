# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Number of Levels / Length of Gameplay - The current state of the game only has 2 levels and neither are very long.
* Support for Other Devices - The game is only supported on PC and Mac (with the support on Mac not being great) and cannot be played on other devices.
* Multiplayer - The current state of the game has no support for multiplayer.&#x20;
* Things to do - The game only has one type of enemy and one type of obstacle, it also only has one objective.



## Maintenance

As of right now I know of no bugs within my game that need fixing, however this doesn't mean It doesn't need maintaining in its current state. I may also wish to add to the game in the future, this inevitably would require more maintenance and would probably also make maintaining the the game more complex.

### Current Size

If I wanted to keep the game the same size and didn't want to add any new features, maintenance would be very simple and i would have to only follow a short term development plan. I would have to address any features that (as of now) i do not consider wholly complete and adapt them within a development cycle, which would probably only require small additions to my code. I would be able to do all of this myself as I am very familiar with my own code and know where my game may need a bit of altering to make it run more smoothly.

### Room for Growth&#x20;

In order to further adapt my game in the future I would first need to complete what i said i would do in the 'Current Size' section so that I would have a much more complete game to springboard off of. Once I have done this I can look at what the current limitations of my game are and begin to think about what I may want to change / add in the future. Of course any new additions or changes made to the game bring with them new bugs or problems that I will have to recognise and fix.

Depending on the scope of what could be added to the game, the complexity of development could increase exponentially. With more complex code, comes more problems and more time consuming maintenance. While there are a few popular games that have been developed by only one person, namely 'Stardew Valley', once a game gets past a certain size or complexity it would become virtually impossible to maintain and update it myself. Therefore, If i was to expand the game largely in the future, it may require a team of people helping with development and maintenance. Each member would have to have a good knowledge of the code and the game itself, so that they can understand how the game should look or run and know how to get it to that point.
