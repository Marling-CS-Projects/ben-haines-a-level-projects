# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Number of Levels / Length of Gameplay - The current state of the game only has 2 levels and neither are very long.
* Support for Other Devices - The game is only supported on PC and Mac (with the support on Mac not being great) and cannot be played on other devices.
* Multiplayer - The current state of the game has no support for multiplayer.&#x20;
* Things to do - The game only has one type of enemy and one type of obstacle, it also only has one objective.



## Maintenance

As of right now I know of no bugs within my game that need fixing, however this doesn't mean It doesn't need maintaining in its current state. I may also wish to add to the game in the future, this inevitably would require more maintenance and would probably also make maintaining the the game more complex.
