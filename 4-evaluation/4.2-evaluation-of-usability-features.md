# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a clear goal to reach to determine the end of a level | Success      |
| 2           | Create a clear goal for any multiplayer modes                | Fail         |

### Feature 1

With a mix of my simple level layout and understanding the title of the game, it is easy to understand that the 'Cash Barrel' is the ending objective of the level.

### Feature 2&#x20;

I never tried to implement a multiplayer mode so this feature is somewhat moot.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                  | Success      |
| 2           | Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions | Success      |

### Feature 1

I have a very simple menu screen that only requires the player to press 'ENTER' to start the game. Although it may be lacking some needed features like level navigation and a tutorial, it still remains quick and easy to navigate through.

### Feature 2

My controls follow the same layout as most other games, using A and D to move and SPACE to jump. These controls are simple and allow the player to do everything they need to do within the game.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a series of levels to work through          | Success      |
| 2           | Create a multiplayer mode to play                  | Fail         |
| 3           | Incorporate a style of game art the suits the game | Success      |

### Feature 1

I have created 2 Levels as of right now for the player to work through, although 2 levels is not a series all the code is in place for me to add more levels later on. All i need to do is design the level and add it to the 'Levels' section of my code. I would still consider this a success.

### Feature 2

I never actually attempted to make my game multiplayer in the end. The overall layout of the game is not optimised for a multiplayer game anyway. In the future i could try to implement a multiplayer mode as i already have the sprites but as of right now i haven't bothered too.

### Feature 3

I have managed to implement a complementary art style to my game, as I said in '[Features of Proposed Solution](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)' I have used a pixelated art style for my game. I have also modelled much of the game around 'Breaking Bad' so that players can recognise the game and the objective easily.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a list of controls for the game                                 | Fail         |
| 2           | Create an in-level guide that helps players learn how to play the game | Fail         |

### Feature 1

I haven't created a list of controls for the game as there are only three different buttons used and these three are what the majority of games use anyway so I didn't feel it necessary.

### Feature 2

Once again I didn't really prioritise this as the game is a very simple platformer where you can figure out what to do by playing it a couple times, so having an in-level guide felt largely unnecessary.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash                                             | Success      |
| 2           | The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | Success      |

### Feature 1

As of right now I have never had the game crash on me while going through development, nor has anyone else who has played the game ([Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)).

### Feature 2&#x20;

As of right now I have never experienced any bugs while going through development, nor has anyone else who has played the game ([Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)).
