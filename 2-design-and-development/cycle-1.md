# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to create the basic mechanics for my game in Kaboom.js. I have made some basic sprites and I would like to be able to make my player sprite move, jump and fall due to gravity. For them to be able to move around I need to add a floor that stops the player falling straight through. If I can I would like to add a sprint feature in which the player moves at 2x speed.&#x20;

* [x] Make the player sprite respond to Gravity &#x20;
* [x] Add a floor that the player can't fall trough
* [x] Have the player be able to move right and east
* [x] Have the player be able to sprint for a short burst&#x20;

### Usability Features

* Controls - I will be using the standard controls for many PC games, WASD and SPACEBAR. A for left, D for right and SPACEBAR to jump. This is what most people are used to so it will be easy to pick up the controls.
* Sprites - By making my player and platforms look like a person and a floor. This helps people clearly understand who they control and what is part of the level.
