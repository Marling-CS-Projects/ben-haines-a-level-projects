# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Describe     |
| 2 - Efficient      | Describe     |
| 3 - Engaging       | Describe     |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Describe     |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Describe     |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### Effective

#### Question 1&#x20;

Having an obvious endpoint to a level is important as it allows the player to more easily determine what to do by backtracking. By asking this question, I can easily say that the cash barrel is quite effective and an overwhelming success.

#### Question 2

It is essential for the objective of the level to be clear so that anyone can start up the game and just get on with playing. With 100% of people saying it is clear what the objective of the level is, I can say that all the features are effective in making the objective clear.

&#x20;

### Efficient&#x20;

#### Question 3&#x20;

Its important for the menus to be clear so that the player can actually start and play the game. Once again the responses show that the start menu is a success.

#### Question 4&#x20;
