## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know how to finish a level? Do you know the objective of the level?                                          |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the start menu clear? Do you know what do after dying or finishing the level? Are the controls simple and clear? |
| 3 - Engaging       | De                                                                                                                  |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Describe                                                                                                            |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Describe                                                                                                            |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### Effective

#### Question 1&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Having an obvious endpoint to a level is important as it allows the player to more easily determine what to do by backtracking. By asking this question, I can easily say that the cash barrel is quite effective and an overwhelming success.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It is essential for the objective of the level to be clear so that anyone can start up the game and just get on with playing. With 100% of people saying it is clear what the objective of the level is, I can say that all the features are effective in making the objective clear.

&#x20;

### Efficient&#x20;

#### Question 3&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Its important for the menus to be clear so that the player can actually start and play the game. Once again the responses show that the start menu is a success.

#### Question 4&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Knowing what to do after dying has proved to be unclear to half the players, this is probably because of the rushed death screen I have used. I should probably (when i have the chance) go back and change it to a more clear death screen.

#### Question 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For a game as simple as mine, the controls should complement that simplicity, while still being effective and easy to learn. It is apparent that my controls were a success in achieving this criteria.

### Engaging&#x20;

#### Question 6&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A game, most importantly, should be fun to play. My game has been an undeniable success in this.

#### Question 7

#### &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\+The style and theme of the game is crucial, as it is what the player actually sees whilst playing - if the player doesn't like what they see then they are less likely to enjoy the game. The style of my game has proven to be a success with 83.3% of  people saying they liked it.

### Error Tolerant&#x20;

#### Question 8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

No one wants to play a game that crashes frequently, no one who has played the game as of yet has experienced it crashing. This also complements my own testing where I didn't experience any crashes.

&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I have partly achieved my goal of having challenging levels. 50% of people say they did not find the level challenging which makes me think I should probably go back and make each level a bit harder.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| X         | describe the criteria |

### Criterion X
