# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Tests

### Cycle 1&#x20;

| Test | Instructions      | What I expect                                              | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Start the game    | The player should fall to the ground but not fall through. | Pass      |
| 2    | Press A and/or D  | The player to move either left or right.                   | Pass      |



### Cycle 2

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                             | Pass/Fail  |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1    | Run Code     | Player and Platform to spawn in, and the player does not fall through it. | Fail       |
| 2    | Run Code     | Platform to be added to the level.                                        | Pass       |

### Cycle 3

<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>Pass/Fail</th><th data-hidden>What actually happens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><p>Preliminary Test</p><p>Run code - make sure it still works fine</p></td><td>Player and Platform to spawn in, and the player does not fall through it.</td><td>Pass</td><td>The Player and Platform Spawned as expected. The player did not fall through.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run new code with Levels const</td><td>Platforms to be added to the level.</td><td>Pass</td><td>The platforms were  added to the level.</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Add end point and run code.</td><td>When the player collides with the end point the level ends and progresses to the next one.</td><td>Pass</td><td>It worked fine (as far as i could tell) but I only have one level at the moment so it returns the player to the home screen.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cycle 4



<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>Pass/Fail</th><th data-hidden>What actually happens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run code and move player.</td><td>The camera to move with the player left and Right .</td><td>Pass</td><td>The camera moves left and right with the player as expected but it wasn't very smooth.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run code and move player.</td><td>The camera to move with the player up and down only.</td><td>Pass</td><td>The camera moves up and down  with the player as expected but it wasn't very smooth.</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Run code and move.</td><td>The camera to move smoothly in both axis </td><td>Fail</td><td>The camera was very jumpy and did not run smoothly at all. However did still somewhat follow the player.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Run code and Move</td><td>The camera to move smoothly in both axis </td><td>Pass</td><td>The camera moved in both axis without a huge amount of latency however it was a little bit 'Framey'</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Run code and Move</td><td>The camera to move smoothly in both axis with the simple code.</td><td>Pass</td><td>The camera moved smoothly in both axis</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cycle 5



<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>Pass/Fail</th><th data-hidden>What actually happens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run Code</td><td>To see the enemy sprites in the level but not doing anything yet</td><td>Pass</td><td>The enemy sprites are in the level</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run Code </td><td>the enemy moving left and right on a loop  </td><td>Fail</td><td>Error message   ".Pos not defined" this is probably a problem with the line of code before rather than the .Pos</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Run Code </td><td>the enemy moving left and right on a loop  </td><td>Fail</td><td>The enemy moves left then right but then stops. I just need to loop it. </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Run Code </td><td>the enemy moving left and right on a loop  </td><td>Fail</td><td>Error message. </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Run New Code </td><td>the enemy spawns in ,the enemy moving left and right on a loop  </td><td>Pass</td><td>Worked as expected</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cycle 6



<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>Pass/Fail</th><th data-hidden>What actually happens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run Code</td><td>Player to 'die' on colliding with the enemy </td><td>Fail</td><td>Error message 'Walt.die' is not a function</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run New Code </td><td>Player to 'die' on colliding with the enemy </td><td>Fail</td><td>Error message 'Walt.die' is not a function</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Run Code with scene code and no die function </td><td></td><td>Fail</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table>
