# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 21        | Game should run without crashing.   |
| 22        | Game should run at at least 30 fps. |

### Criterion 21

To test this, I started by playing my game as you would normally and experienced no crashes or game-stopping bugs. Then I started to overload the game with multiple inputs in an attempt to put the game under as much stress as possible but, due to the simplicity of my game, there wasn't much I could do to put the game under more strain - because of this despite my best efforts to crash the game all I ever experienced was a frame rate drop of 3 frames at most.&#x20;

### Criterion 22&#x20;

Kaboom.js has a built in feature for showing the games fps. My game at the moment is averaging 60 fps ( well above my aim ) but it can experience sudden drops down to 27 fps but this fps is still high enough for the game to run ok.&#x20;

I did, however, experience significantly lower fps when running the game on my MacBook, I'm still not entirely sure why this is the case, it could be the different OS or maybe my home WIFI. &#x20;
